Description of the Software
===========================


This project implements an intuitive gaphical user interface (GUI) for a software defined radio (SDR), which is used for nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy. Central features are:
 * an automatic data handling system for an efficient testing and measuring. 
 * an automated, structured workflow minimises the risk of experimental errors and the loss of acquired data. 
 * a sequence generator for building multipulse sequences with to ten pulses. Individual phases can be set for each pulse between φmin =0 and φmax =2π
 * as the software shall be used for academic lab exercises, a plausability check of all input variabels is included. Hence warnings will be communicated if there is the danger of damaging the hardware controlled by the GUI. 
 * experienced users can load standardised .cfg files from the system.
